          <h3>What is MusicWheel?</h3>
          <p>MusicWheel is an interactive tool for exploring music theory. It visualizes notes, scales, and chords on a circular display, and lets you hear how different tuning systems affect the sound of music.</p>
          
          <h3>Playing Notes</h3>
          <p>There are two ways to play notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Number row</strong> (<kbd>1</kbd> through <kbd>=</kbd>): Plays all 12 notes in Western music, starting from your chosen root note. These are the "chromatic" notes - every key on a piano, both white and black.</li>
            <li><strong>Letter row</strong> (<kbd>q</kbd> through <kbd>]</kbd>): Plays only the notes in your selected scale (usually 7 notes). This makes it easy to improvise without hitting "wrong" notes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can also click notes on the wheel. When you play multiple notes together, the app identifies the <strong>chord</strong> (a group of notes that sound good together) and displays its name in the center. Common chords include <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Equal Tempered,C,Major|C+E+G|1500">major (happy/bright)</a>, <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Equal Tempered,C,Minor|C+D#+G|1500">minor (sad/dark)</a>, and <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Equal Tempered,C,Major|C+E+G+A#|1500">seventh chords (jazzy/complex)</a>.</p>
          
          <h3>The Wheel</h3>
          <p>The wheel shows all 12 notes arranged in a circle. Bright notes are "in the scale" - they belong to your selected key and will sound harmonious together. Dimmed notes are "outside the scale" - they can add tension or color but may clash.</p>
          <p><strong>Circle of Fifths:</strong> This toggle changes how notes are arranged. Normally notes go up by half-steps (C, C#, D, D#...). The Circle of Fifths arranges them by "fifths" instead (C, G, D, A...). A fifth is the interval from "do" to "sol" - one of the most consonant sounds in music. This arrangement reveals why certain chords sound good together: neighbors on the circle share many notes.</p>
          <p><strong>Chromatic Colors:</strong> Changes whether colors represent pitch (low=red to high=violet) or position in the circle of fifths.</p>
          <p>The small dot shows the <strong>relative major/minor</strong>. Every major key has a "relative minor" that shares all the same notes but starts on a different root. For example, C Major and A Minor use the same seven notes (all white keys on a piano).</p>
          
          <h3>Scales and Modes</h3>
          <p>A <strong>scale</strong> is a collection of notes that sound good together. The most common are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Major</strong> - Bright and happy (think "Happy Birthday")</li>
            <li><strong>Minor</strong> - Dark and melancholy (think minor-key movie themes)</li>
            <li><strong>Pentatonic</strong> - A 5-note scale common in rock, blues, and folk music worldwide</li>
            <li><strong>Blues</strong> - Pentatonic plus one extra "blue note" that gives it that bluesy sound</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Modes</strong> are variations of the major scale, each starting on a different note. They all use the same seven notes but have different "home bases," creating distinct moods:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ionian</strong> - The standard major scale</li>
            <li><strong>Dorian</strong> - Minor but with a brighter 6th; common in jazz and Celtic music</li>
            <li><strong>Phrygian</strong> - Minor with a dark, Spanish/Middle Eastern flavor</li>
            <li><strong>Lydian</strong> - Major but dreamy and floating; the "Simpsons theme" sound</li>
            <li><strong>Mixolydian</strong> - Major but with a bluesy 7th; common in rock</li>
            <li><strong>Aeolian</strong> - The natural minor scale</li>
            <li><strong>Locrian</strong> - Unstable and tense; rarely used as a "home" scale</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The app shows which major key shares the same notes. For instance, D Dorian uses the same notes as C Major - it's just "C Major starting on D."</p>
          
          <h3>Chord Progressions</h3>
          <p>A <strong>chord progression</strong> is a sequence of chords. Most songs use the same few progressions. The numbers (1, 4, 5, etc.) refer to scale degrees - if you're in C Major, 1=C, 4=F, 5=G.</p>
          <p>Progressions are <strong>mode-aware</strong>: the same "1-4-5" pattern produces major chords in a major key but minor chords in a minor key. Try switching between C Major and C Minor while a progression plays to hear the difference.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1-4-5-1</strong> - The foundation of rock, country, and blues</li>
            <li><strong>1-5-6-4</strong> - The "pop progression" used in hundreds of hit songs</li>
            <li><strong>2-5-1</strong> - The jazz turnaround; creates strong resolution</li>
            <li><strong>12 Bar Blues</strong> - The classic blues structure</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Temperaments (Tuning Systems)</h3>
          <p>Here's a secret: the notes on a piano are slightly "out of tune" - on purpose! A <strong>temperament</strong> is a system for tuning notes. The challenge is mathematical: you can't have perfectly pure fifths (3:2 frequency ratio) AND perfectly pure thirds (5:4 frequency ratio) AND be able to play in any key. Different temperaments make different trade-offs.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> Except for Equal Tempered, all temperaments are "keyed" - they're designed around a specific root note. The samples in this app are tuned relative to C, so C Major represents the "home" key where the tuning is optimized. When you select a different root note, the temperament characteristics shift accordingly - you're essentially playing in a key that's "farther" or "closer" to the tuning's home base.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Equal Tempered</strong> (Modern Standard)</p>
          <p>The one temperament that isn't keyed. Every half-step is exactly the same size, so every key sounds identical and you can transpose freely. The trade-off: no interval is perfectly pure (e.g. a perfect fifth should be 3:2 = 1.5, but in equal temperament it's ~1.498). This tiny compromise in every interval is why modern instruments can play in any key. This is how virtually all contemporary instruments are tuned. Listen to <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Equal Tempered,C,Major|C+E+G|2000">C Major</a> then <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Equal Tempered,F#,Major|F#+A#+C#|2000">F# Major</a> - they sound identical in character.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Well Tempered</strong> (Baroque Era)</p>
          <p>Notes are adjusted so that all keys are playable, but each key retains its own "color." Keys close to C (few sharps/flats) sound purer and brighter because the tuning favors them. Keys far from C (like F# Major with six sharps) accumulate small tuning compromises that make them sound more tense and darker. Bach wrote "The Well-Tempered Clavier" specifically to showcase how each of the 24 keys has its own character. Compare <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Well Tempered,C,Major|C+E+G|2000">C Major (pure)</a> to <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Well Tempered,F#,Major|F#+A#+C#|2000">F# Major (edgy)</a> - you'll hear C sound clean while F# has more tension.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Pythagorean</strong> (Ancient Greek)</p>
          <p>Built entirely by stacking pure fifths (3:2 ratio) starting from C. Fifths sound incredibly pure, but here's the problem: if you stack 12 perfect fifths (C→G→D→A→E→B→F#→C#→G#→D#→A#→F→C), you should return to C - but mathematically, you land slightly sharp. This leftover error (called the "Pythagorean comma") has to go somewhere, creating one horribly out-of-tune interval called the <strong>"wolf fifth"</strong> - traditionally placed between G# and Eb where it was least likely to be needed. <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Pythagorean|G#+D#|2500">Hear the wolf fifth</a> - instead of a pure fifth, you get a dissonant howl! Compare to a <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Pythagorean|C+G|2500">pure C-G fifth</a>.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Carlos Super Just</strong></p>
          <p>Created by electronic music pioneer Wendy Carlos for her groundbreaking synthesizer albums. This is a form of "just intonation" - tuning based on pure mathematical ratios. Chords in C and nearby keys sound incredibly pure and beatless because their intervals are exact ratios (like 5:4 for major thirds). But this purity comes at a cost: keys far from C sound noticeably out of tune. Compare <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Carlos Super Just,C,Major|C+E+G|2000">C Major (pure, locked-in)</a> to <a href="#" class="demo-link" data-sequence="Carlos Super Just,F#,Major|F#+A#+C#|2000">F# Major (buzzy, restless)</a> to hear the dramatic difference.</p>
